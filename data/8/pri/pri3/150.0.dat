.SEGMENT TEXT 0-1531 ? "Studying in Princeton has been a really remarkable experience. It is an entirely different world from the one I have known. The education system is refreshingly different from the U.K. system which I grew up on. We no longer learn by rote, nor is there such a great obsession with grades (though that may be only a preliminary assessment/impression). The professors encourage a great deal of participation in class also. This is similar to class in secondary school, since I was in the Gifted Education Programme. However, it differs from junior college, when the programme came to an end. The liberal arts system is also good because it enables a person to be more well-rounded. It is certainly refreshing to be studying arts again after being in a pure science course for two whole years. Another aspect of \"the American experience\" has been the culture. It has been eye-opening, for I confess to having been relatively sheltered in Singapore. Issues such as drugs, violence and various other crimes become very much a part of our lives. It is initially rather frightening, but a very relevant part of one's education. Studying here also means that I am living and interacting with a very different group of people, for the difference between my old friends and those that I have made here is rather stark. It must be due to the culture."
