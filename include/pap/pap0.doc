 The writers were volunteers recruited from amongst the family and
 circle of the development team members, visitors to the 
 Papyrus offices, and other occupants of the office building.  
 The writers were for the most part not computer professionals. 
 The samples were collected over a period of 18 months.  For about 
 75% of the writers, the sessions were scheduled in advance.  The 
 remainder of the writers were recruited "on the spot".

 The sessions lasted aproximately 30 minutes.  Writers wrote on a back-lit
 LCD tablet (Wacom PL100V), seated at a desk in the Papyrus office.
 
 The test conditions can be described generally as "cooperative walk-up".
 At the start of a session, the test supervisor demonstrated the 
 input system and wrote a few examples. Subjects were asked to use 
 their "natural style" but to make a  "reasonable effort" to write 
 "neatly".  The writers were then presented with 15 "practice" words, 
 which were repeated up to 4 times until recognized. This allowed the 
 user to become accustomed to the pen and tablet. The practice words 
 were not recorded. During the practice, the test supervisor commented 
 on writing habits that might present problems for the recognizer and 
 repeated the instructions to write "neatly" and "to form each letter".
 
 After the practice, which normally lasted 5 to 10 minutes, the writers 
 were presented with one of 5 standard sets of 100 words to write.   
 The test sets were chosen so that all letters and the most common 
 digrams and trigrams were represented. 
 
 The system presented the words one at a time. When data collection first 
 began, users were obliged to "retry" up to three times until a word was 
 recognized.  Beginning in January 1994, this practice was discontinued
 and the test supervisor asked the writer to retry only in the case of 
 a "false start" or mis-spelling, with these subsequently being removed 
 from the data.   The system also did not permit ink-on-ink corrections, 
 and when the test supervisor noticed that the user had attempted this, 
 the word was also retried.

 During the practice and testing, the recognizer was turned on.  
 Alternates as well as the the highest-ranked word were displayed.  
 Most writers studied the results, and discussed some failures briefly with 
 the test supervisor, especially when the result was remote from the 
 test word.
 
 Recognition began after a  two-second timeout, allowing the writer time to 
 add marks (dots on i's, bars on t's, accent marks, etc). During the test, 
 the system showed the number of words recognized so far. Writers were 
 told that the average was 80% to 90%, and were encouraged to try 
 to achieve a "high score".

 In some cases, especially where the writer had a computer science
 background, the writer had to be asked not to attempt to "challenge" or
 "experiment with" the recognizer and to make a "reasonable effort" 
 to have the words be recognized, "as if you have spent $1000 
 on a pen computer and are motivated to be able to use it to enter data."  
 For about 3% of the writers, the session was terminated early 
 because the writer would not cooperate.  These writers are not 
 represented in the UNIPEN data.

 If the subject used a letter model which the test supervisor knew the 
 recognizer had not been trained for, the subject was informed and asked to
 continue to use it for several words.   When the supervisor was 
 satisfied that several examples of the model had been collected, the 
 subject would be asked to try to form that letter in a different way, 
 especially if the letter was a common one.   Most writers were not 
 capable of doing this consistently.  On the other hand, it was obvious 
 that under these test conditions, many writers were slightly altering 
 their normal method of writing in order to achieve "better results".  
 Indeed, this was the intent of the test design. Some writers seemed 
 to do this unconsciously, and commented that the recognizer was 
 "learning" their style.  In fact, this was not the case. 

 During the 18 month period of data collection, both the recognizer and 
 the test protocol evolved somewhat.  While each set of writer samples is
 homogenous, the test conditions and the characteristics of the recognizer 
 (and therefore the recognizer feedback) varied somewhat between writers.
