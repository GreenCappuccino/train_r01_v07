.SETUP          Site:           Philips Research Laboratories (Eindhoven) and LEP (Paris)
                Time:           May 93
                Conditions:     Writers were sitted
                Writers:        Volunteers
                Form:           One box, only one word at a time:
                                "Please write the word xxxx"
                Acquisition
                software:       "wordaki", LEP made Pen-Windows application
                                running under Windows 3.1

.DATA_INFO	    Alphabet:  lower case and upper case
                Lexicon:	1764 english words, selected at random from the
                           "ispell" dictionary (approx 50000 words) see file
                           "lexicon".
                Style:		Discrete characters, relatively widely spaced.
                           It was explicitly forbidden to overlap two characters.
					            Writers were instructed to respect lower-case upper-case
                           dependancy (thus "THIS", "This" and "this" are the 3
                           manners to write the lexical word "THIS"). However,
                           this is not 100% true because we did not force a
                           normalized shape for each character and for some
                           people a "lower case m" looks very much like a upper
									case machine-printed one !
                Quality:	Checked data: these files were visually checked by 2
                           different persons during 2 separate sessions, then a
                           recognition system was run on them and recognition
                           "errors" were extracted in order to check if they
                           were true recognition errors or labelling errors. 

                Segmentation:	NONE

.COMMENT

WRITER_ID is indicated in each file and is also in the file name
writers are coded with 3 letters.
the WRITER_ID in each file is composed as follow:
phil-writer-<writer-code>
filenames are composed as follow:
<writer-code>.<session-code>.unipen
there was 8 sessions as follow:
4 sessions with MOSTLY FRENCH writers: p1,p2,p3,p4
4 sessions with MOSTLY DUTCH  writers: h6,h7,h8,h9
but nationality is not known for sure (not recorded at session time),
so it is not indicated in the files.
The same writer may appear in several sessions.

writer SEX is indicated for each file, most are male.

.STYLE		PRINTED
.COORD X Y

.COMMENT Writers were instructed to write "rather widely spaced" but otherwise "naturaly".
         It was explicitly forbidden to overlap two characters.
         Writers were instructed to repect case dependance, this is mostly true but not 100% true
         because some letters have allographs that are mix of uppercase and lowercase
         Dutch people may write a "lower case r" or "lower case m" that look very much like upper-case ones,
         some French "lower case f" look also very much like upper-case ones, etc...
