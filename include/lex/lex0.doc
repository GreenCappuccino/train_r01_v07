.COMMENT Use the .ALPHABET specified (the same for all the databases of the
         benchmark). It should be a superset of the character labels that
         you are using. Optionally use .ALPHABET_FREQ to specify character
         frequencies by replacing the 1's by appropriate values. The character
		 frequencies are defined in file lex0.freq

.COMMENT Use .HIERARCHY TEXT for unsegmented text.
         Use .HIERARCHY TEXT WORD if both .SEGMENT types TEXT and
         WORD appear in the data file in which this file is included.
         Use .HIERARCHY TEXT WORD CHARACTER if all three types are
         used. The text labels may contain any characters from .ALPHABET.
         If there are restrictions on the character set, please
         specify them with .ALPHABET_SET in the data file directly.

.HIERARCHY      TEXT WORD

         Please replace numbers by adequate values. .X_DIM and .Y_DIM define
         the bounding box. .H_LINE is the baseline which may be optionally
         specified. All characters must fit in the same bounding box. The
         UNIPEN coordinate system must be strictly observed (0 at the lower
         left corner, X axis pointing to the right, Y axis pointing to the
         top).
