.SETUP   Site:  	Unversity of the West of Englang
         Time:  	Dec 1993 - May 1994
	 Writer population:	University staff and students
	 Writer motivation:     Small fee to encourage volunteers
         Writer physical position:	Sitting at desk.
	 Instructions given to the writer:
		Copy isolated word or multi-word name as prompted on screen
		at natural writing pace and style (no special neatness
		requested).
		Donors had ok/cancel buttons to validate their own input.
	 Recognizer feedback: No.
         Form layout:  Single plain box, no guidelines.

.DATA_INFO    
	 Set type: Variability experiments
	 Alphabet: English keyboard alphanumerics and minimal punctuation.
         Lexicon:  Proper names and acronymic abbreviations as might appear
         	   in a personal phone list.
         Label distribution: 
         Quantity: 200 words (or multi word names) per instance
         Quality:  Self validation by writer. Post validation of instances A,
                   B, C (but not, yet, D) by separate annotator.
         Number of Writer(s): 25
         Writing Style: Natural - thus mixed, print and cursive stylse
         Segmentation: No further segmentation
  	 Note 1:
		The purpose of this data is to study writer variability. Two
		instances were collected on one day and further repeats after
		1 week and then 5 months were collected. 
		To reflect this is the UNIPEN format data we have used the
		file name convention:  hpb4Xwww.dat. Where www is the writer
		id and X is 1, 2, 3, 5 to indicate first instance, second
		instance (after 1 hour), third instance (after 1 week) and
		final instance (after 5 months).
	Note 2:
		Most problem instances detected by the post annotation phase
		are small ink drop outs rather than complete illegibility. We
		thus used the ? rather than BAD segment label for these cases.
 	Note 3:
		This data is low (screen) resolution. This was deliberate and
		reflects the real application context for our work. Our
		published results show that this resolution (and the noise on
		the sampling interval) do not significantly affect our
		ability to perform matching on such handwriting. Early
		experiments with commercial recognisers shows that the
		reduced resolution has negligable effect on recognition as
		well.

.PAD     Machine name: 	Wacom PL100-V
	 Brand:		Wacom
	 Type:		PC-100V
	 Serial Nr.:	?
         Sensor:	Electromagnetic, wireless pen
         Pen:		Untethered inking pen, tip switch, ball point refill
			Tip switch used for pen up/down sensing.
         Driver:	Custom driver which uses standard Wacom mouse
		        emulator driver and captures pen movements using
		        Windows mouse move events.
         		N.B. This results in low (screen) resolution data
         		with some in accuracies in timing but see above note3. 
	 Sampling mode: Equi-time sampling (with some noise) during pen down.
	 Sampling rate: 100 [Hz]
	 Resolution:	0.3mm
	 Accuracy:	.1  [mm]
	 Width:		192 [mm]
	 Height:	153 [mm]
         Display:	Wacom PL-100V backlit LCD screen (VGA, 640x480).
	 Inking:	Graphically emulated, black on white, 1 pixel thick.
