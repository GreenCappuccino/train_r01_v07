.SETUP  
        Site: BBN and an office near MIT
        Time: spring 1993, 9am-7pm
        Writers: mostly students, young professionals
	Writer motivation: paid ($30 cash for first 3 hours, 
		$12/hour thereafter)
	Writer physical position: a desk was provided, no constraints
		on writer's position
	Instructions given to the writer: Subjects were told to copy
		the text displayed on a computer screen by writing in
		cursive on the computer screen on the lines below the
		text.  (Print out the "acquire.ps" file in the
		documents directory for a digitized picture of our
		setup.)  They were told that we would prefer that they
		write capitals in cursive but that it was not
		necessary.  Also, all lower case letters had to be
		connected, i.e. the pen could not be lifted to dot i's
		or j's or cross x's or t's as a word was being
		written, only after the last letter was finished.
		Further, no touch-ups were allowed, i.e. letters could
		not be made to look more distinct after they were
		written.  However, subjects were allowed to "erase" or
		"undo" the last pen strokes made to correct mistakes.
	Duration of one session: 1 hour maximum per day
	Recognizer feedback: yes; electronic ink was used to provide
		feedback to writer but no recognition was performed
	Form layout: print out or display acquire.ps (a digitized
		picture in PostScript) in the documents directory	
        Conditions: supervised recording conditions

.DATA_INFO
	Set type: training
        Alphabet: English keyboard alphanumerics and symbols from the
		ASCII set
        Lexicon: text from a (many) "Wall Street Journal(s)"
        Quality: cleaning; verified the data visually using in-house
		software after writer was done with session; 
		only touch ups made were additions of missed i-dots
		(mostly	not picked up by the computer), deletions
	 	of stray marks (including extra i-dots and periods),
		and corrections of stroke order (i.e. period and
		commas should come after i-dots and t-crosses)
        Number of writer(s): 21
        Writing style: Natural
        Segmentation: TEXT
