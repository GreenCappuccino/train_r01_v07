.SETUP   Site:  	Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Bristol
         Time:  	May 1992
	 Writer population:	Staff at HP Labs Bristol
	 Writer motivation:     Volunteer
         Writer physical position:	Sitting at desk.
	 Instructions given to the writer:
		Copy paragraphs given on printed prompt sheets.
		Each paragraph had different instructions on style - either
		"normal" or "printed" styles were requested. Several
		paragraphs were repeated for the two styles.
	 Duration of one session: Approximately 45 mins.
	 Recognizer feedback: No.
         Form layout:
		Plain lined paper.

.DATA_INFO    
	 Set type: test
	 Alphabet: English keyboard alphanumerics and symbols 
		   from the ASCII set
         Lexicon:  Small set of common english words, proper names and digits.
		   The paragraphs were selected to cover several example
		   tasks (PIM entries, phone book entries, transcription from
		   books, full-alphabet sentencee). The lexicon is simply the
		   concatenation of the words in these selected texts.
         Label distribution: 
         Quantity: 500+ words per writer.
         Quality:  Manual segmentation and labelling by single experimenter.
         Number of Writer(s): 25
         Writing Style:
		Both "natural" and forced printed.
         Segmentation:
		Semi-automatic segmentation followed by manual error
		correction.
  	 Note:
		A side effect of the convoluted translation path to generate
		the UNIPEN format means that pen-up timing information has
		been lost. Dummy PEN_UP records have been inserted.
