.SETUP   Site:  	Stanford University
         Time:  	Summer 1991
	 Writer population:	Students and staff of Stanford University
	 Writer motivation:     Paid (few $ per 1000 words)
         Writer physical position:	Sitting at desk.
	 Instructions given to the writer:
		"Write words as neatly and naturally as possible."
		Single words, numbers and sentences, read out in random order
		from audio tape. 
		Experimenter continuously monitored collection on second
		screen and sometimes asked for words to be rewritten.
	 Duration of one session: Approximately 2 hours.
	 Recognizer feedback: No.
         Form layout:  
		Lined paper, appoximately 3 words written per line.  Initial
         	segmentation carried by time (sync to tape recorder) rather
         	than by spatial position.

.DATA_INFO    
	 Set type: training and test, writer subset designated for test
	 ^^^^^^^^         
	 Alphabet: English keyboard alphanumerics and symbols 
		   from the ASCII set
         Lexicon:  basic.lex, Basic English
         Label distribution: ??
         Quantity: 750 words, 50 numbers, 12 sentences per writer
		   This data set contains segmented sentence data, words and
		   numbers in separate data set (hpb0).
         Quality:  
		(a) Initial monitoring by experimenter to request rewrites.
		(b) Detection of suspect cases using preliminary recogniser
		    Manual inspection of suspect cases with labelling or
		    correction as appropriate.
         Number of Writer(s): 95
         Writing Style: 
		"Natural", includes primarly printed, primarily
                cursive and mixed.
         Segmentation:
		(a) Time based segmentation of words from stimulus.
		(b) Manual correction of segmentation errors in suspect words.
		(c) Manual segmentation of sentence data into words.
