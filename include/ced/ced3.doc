                           State University of New York at Buffalo
                   Dates:  September - Octorber 1994
                   Writer population:  Most of the writers were students,  
		      staffs and faculty at SUNY/Buffalo.  However, there 
		      were some from other parts of the Western New York area.
                   Writer motivation:  The majority of writers were paid
                      $7.00 for their participation.  However, there were
                      also many volunteers.  (Most volunteers were people
                      who worked at CEDAR.)
                   Writer physical position:  Sitting.
                   Instructions given to the writer:  Writers were asked to 
		      follow comb guidelines carefully but no restriction on
		      printed/cursive style was imposed.
                   Duration of one session:  Approximately 15 mins. This is 
		      1/3 of the entire data collecting procedure. The whole
		      procedure took about one hour.
                   Data collection procedure: Writers were asked to transcribe 
		      words/text shown on the screen into combs that were 
		      provided. There were a total of 44 isolated words plus
		      9 equations. 
                   Machines:  WACOM PL100-V connected to a PC.
