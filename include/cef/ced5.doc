                   Site:   CEDAR Offices, 520 Lee Entrance, Suite 202
                           State University of New York at Buffalo
                   Dates:  September - Octorber 1994
                   Writer population:  Most of the writers were students,  
		      staffs and faculty at SUNY/Buffalo.  However, there 
		      were some from other parts of the Western New York area.
                   Writer motivation:  The majority of writers were paid
                      $7.00 for their participation.  However, there were
                      also many volunteers.  (Most volunteers were people
                      who worked at CEDAR.)
                   Writer physical position:  Sitting.
                   Instructions given to the writer:  Writers were asked to 
                      follow comb guidelines carefully but no restriction on
                      printed/cursive style was imposed.
                   Duration of one session:  Approximately 15 mins. This is 
		      1/3 of the entire data collecting procedure. The whole
		      procedure took about one hour.
                   Data collection procedure: Writers were asked to transcrib
		      14 postal addresses (one at a time) selected randomly
		      from the NYNEX address CD-ROM. Each address was written
		      in 3 boxes (one box per address line) that were provided
		      (see Addresslayout.ps).
                   Machines:  WACOM PL100-V connected to a PC.
