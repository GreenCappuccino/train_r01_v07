.DATA_INFO      Set type:    This database has been designed mainly for 
                             the learning. 

                Alphabet:       English keyboard alphanumerics and symbols
                                from the ASCII set.

                                Thus: latin alphabet uppercase, lowercase, 
                                digits(few) and symbols: "-", ".", "'".
                                See the .ALPHABET and .ALPHABET_FREQ here
                                below.

                Lexicon: This database contains two different dataset:

                    1.  The first one, segmented at the character level
                        contains the 65 symbols present in the used
                        alphabet.  These characters where presented one
                        by one to the seven writers in a random order.
                        They were asked to write them in a natural way,
                        but with the same writing style as the one it
                        would have if the letters were written inside a
                        word.  This first dataset corresponds to the
                        seven "ff_ll_c.dat" files, where ff are the
                        initials of the writer's first name and ll the
                        initials of its last name.

                    2.  The second dataset, corresponding to the seven
                        "ff_ll_w.dat" files contains 425 words (2608
                        characters) chosen to build an efficient
                        learnset, containing the greatest number of
                        different within-writer writing style by letter
                        (for a same writer, the writing style of a
                        letter inside a word is most of the time
                        dependant of the word context, i.e. mainly the
                        preceding and following letter in the word).

            This second learnset was build from the 83500 words of the
            english dictionary provided with the ispell interactive
            spelling checker version 3.1 (Copyright 1992, 1993, Geoff
            Kuenning, Granada Hills, CA).  This version of ispell is
            available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.ucla.edu
            (131.179.128.34) or ftp.math.orst.edu (128.193.80.160), in
            the pub/ispell-3.1 directory.


            The words of the second dataset were chosen to respect the 
            following constraints:

                - Every symbol of the 65 character alphabet (less the 0
                  to 9 digits) had to appear at least once in the
                  dataset  (uppercase letters having to appear at the
                  first position of a word.

                - Every pair of lowercase letters appearing in at least
                  15 words of the 83500 words ispell dictionary must
                  appear at least once.  According to this constraint,
                  526 pairs of lowercases on the 676 (26x26) possible
                  are present in the dataset; the remaining 150
                  combinaisons (like "qw" "qx" "qy" "qz" "rx",...) are
                  not present.

                - Every pair of an uppercase prededing a lowercase at
                  the beginning of at least 15 words of the 83500 words
                  ispell dictionary must appear at least once (keeping
                  in mind that every common noun may begin with an
                  uppercase).  According to this constraint, 235 pairs
                  of an uppercase prededing a lowercase at the
                  beginning of a word are present in the dataset; the
                  remaining 441 combinaison (like "Ft", "Bs", "Qk",...)
                  are not present.

                - The number of words in de dataset had to be
                  mimimized.

            The 425 words dataset was build after an exhaustive search
            combined with a size minimization procedure. It contains
            commonly used words like "Erase", "Me", "exact","Usable",
            ...; but also less common words which were present in the
            dictionary ("Rijn", "Cedar", "Emacs", "czarism", "McAdams",
            "Rajput", ...).

            See the lou0.lex file for more information.

 
                                        
                Quantity:       The character dataset contains 65 isolated
                                characters while the words dataset contains 
                                425 isolated words (2608 characters).
                                The present database contains the two 
                                datasets written by seven different writers.

                                Thus 455 isolated characters and 2975 isolated 
                                words (18256 characters).

                THERE IS ONE FILE PER DATASET: "ff_ll_c.dat" FOR THE 65     
                CHARACTERS DATASET AND "ff_ll_w.dat" FOR THE 425 WORDS DATASET.
                WHERE ff CORRESPONDS TO THE INITIALS OF THE WRITER'S FIRST
                NAME, ll TO THE INITIALS OF ITS LAST NAME AND NN is A NUMBER 
                (WHEN THE SAME WRITER WROTE THE TEXT MORE THAN ONCE)


                Quality:        Writers were asked to rewrite 
                                each scratched or too bad-written words.
                                Each word was double checked and 
                                the legibility was checked by a different
                                person than the writer.
                                
                Number of writers: 7 They have all written the two datasets
                                     only one time.
                                     The seven different writers have also 
                                     written the "lou1" testset.
                                     
                Writing style:  Natural (no constraint).
                                Thus Mixed Cursive, Discrete, Run-on Discrete
                                and printed (for uppercase words and digits).

                Segmentation:   For the words dataset, words were written 
                                in one box, one by one.
                                For the characters dataset, characters were 
                                written in one box, one by one.

                Time:           May, Augustus and September 1994.

                Writer population: Members of the laboratory, 
                                   students working in the area of
                                   Character Recognition.

                Writers motivation: volunteer.

                Conditions:     Supervised recording conditions.

                                The different words and characters
                                were proposed one by one.       
                                No time constraint.

                                Writers were first trained on about
                                60 words before the creation of the database.

                                Writers were asked to rewrite 
                                each scratched or too bad-written words.

                Writer physical position: People sitting at a desk with 
                                the screen of the Macintosh at about 
                                0.5 meter.
                                People were asked to take the more
                                comfortable position for the writing
                                on the tablet.

                Duration of one session: About one hour.

                Recognizer feedback:    no 

          
                Form layout:    Window with 
                                A 74x330 box with a dashed baseline
                                  at 2/3 from the top (to help the writer).
                                A box to indicate the word to write.  
                                Buttons CLEAR (if the writing of a word 
                                was bad) and NEXT (for the presentation 
                                and the writing of the next word)
                                A slider to check the database or move
                                into it. Home-made interface, see the

                Thus no .DT information.
                No data was recorded when the pen was in the up positions.
