.DATA_INFO      Set type:       Test.

	        Alphabet:	English keyboard alphanumerics and symbols
                                from the ASCII set.

				Thus: latin alphabet uppercase, lowercase, 
                                digits(few) and symbols: "-", ".", "'".
				See the .ALPHABET and .ALPHABET_FREQ here
				below.

		Lexicon:	The text from a letter in the IEEE
                                SPECTRUM of February 1994 (page 15):

                                Technically speaking, "The pocket 
				computer's many aliases", Kevin Self.

				See the .LEXICON_INFO in the 
				"lou1.lex" included file.

				All the punctuation signs were removed, except
				the points of abbreviated words ("Calif.",
				"Mass.", "Inc.", "Corp."), the apostrophes
				("doesn't", "today's", "clients'", 
				"computer's") and the hyphen of compound
				words ("pen-based", "write-o", 
				"Globe-trotters", "well-educated")
				which were all considered as one word.

				All the numerals were kept as words 
				("1995", "92", "85", "1994", "15")

				All the uppercases were kept: Names of
				people, companies, cities, begin 
				of sentences, ...

				There are also uppercase words:
				("IEEE", "FEBRUARY", "SPECTRUM", "BIS")
                                         
                Quantity:       The entire text contains 458 isolated
				words (2410 characters).
				The present database contains all the
				words of the text written 15 times 
				by different writers.
				Thus 6870 words - 36150 characters.

                THERE IS ONE FILE PER ENTIRE TEXT: "ff_llNN.dat"
                WHERE ff CORRESPONDS TO THE INITIALS OF THE WRITER'S FIRST
		NAME, ll TO THE INITIALS OF ITS LAST NAME AND NN is A NUMBER 
		(WHEN THE SAME WRITER WROTE THE TEXT MORE THAN ONCE)

		Quality:        Writers were asked to rewrite 
				each scratched or too bad-written words.
				Each word was double checked and 
				the legibility was checked by a different
				person than the writer.
				
		Number of writers: 10: 8 of them have written the 
					 text once,
				       1 has written 3 times,
				       1 has written 4 times.
				Seven of these 10 writers have also written 
				the lou0 database.
				     
		Writing style:	Natural (no constraint).
				Thus Mixed Cursive, Discrete, Run-on Discrete
				and printed (for uppercase words and digits).

		Segmentation:	Words written in one box, one by one.
				 
				For the segmentation "computer's", "write-o",
				"today's", "pen-based" were considered as 
				one word.

.SETUP		Site:		Microelectronics Laboratory, 
				Office a134 (the best).

		Time:		May, Augustus and September 1994.

		Writer population: Members of the laboratory, 
				   students working in the area of
				   Character Recognition.

		Writers motivation: volunteer.

		Conditions:	Supervised recording conditions.

			        The different words of the text
				were proposed one by one.
				It was thus very difficult for the writer to 
				understand the meaning of the text he was 
				writing.

				No time constraint.

				Writers were first trained on about
				60 words before the creation of the database.

				Writers were asked to rewrite 
				each scratched or too bad-written words.

                Writer physical position: People sitting at a desk with 
				the screen of the Macintosh at about 
				0.5 meter.
				People were asked to take the more
				comfortable position for the writing
				on the tablet.

                Duration of one session: About one hour.

		Recognizer feedback:	no 

	  
		Form layout:	Window with 
				A 74x330 box with a dashed baseline
				  at 2/3 from the top (to help the writer).
				A box to indicate the word to write.  
				Buttons CLEAR (if the writing of a word 
				was bad) and NEXT (for the presentation 
				and the writing of the next word)
				A slider to check the database or move
				into it. Home-made interface, see the
             			postcript "layout.eps" document for more 
				info.



.PAD			Machine name:	CIC-MacHandwriter (CalComp digitizer

			Sensor:		Electromagnetic, wireless pen.

			Pen:		Untethered Pen, tip switch and 
                                        side button.
                                        Tip switch used for PenUp/PenDown

                                              store(".PEN_DOWN");
                                              while(PEN_DOWN){
                                                 store (X and Y) every 8ms ;
                                                 }
                                              store(".PEN_UP");
                                              }
                                            }

	         	Sample rate:       125            [Hz]
         		Resolution:        80             [points/inch]
         		Width:             202            [mm]
         		Height:            152            [mm]



			Display:	Macintosh's screen:

.COMMENT	Elapsed time measured when pen was immobile or out 
		of proximity of the pad sensors were not recorded.
		Thus no .DT information.
		No data was recorded when the pen was in the up positions.
