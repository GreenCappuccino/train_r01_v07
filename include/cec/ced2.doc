                           State University of New York at Buffalo
                   Dates:  June - September 1994
                   Writer population:  Most of the writers were students
                      at SUNY/Buffalo.  However, there were some from other
                      parts of the Western New York area.
                   Writer motivation:  The majority of writers were paid
                      $7.00 for their participation.  However, there were
                      also many volunteers.  (Most volunteers were people
                      who worked at CEDAR.)
                   Writer physical position:  Sitting.
                   Instructions given to the writer:  No special instructions 
		      given. They were told to write naturally.
                   Duration of one session:  Approximately one hour.
                   Data collection procedure:  Writers listened to spoken
                      sentences on a pair of headphones.  After hearing 
                      each sentence, they would write in on a blank sheet 
                      of lined paper which had been placed on the tablet.  
                      Writers had the option to replay and rewrite the 
                      sentence as many times as they wanted.
                   Machines:  WACOM SD-311E tablet connected to SUN 
		      SPARCstation IPC.  Sentences displayed on SUN monitor.
